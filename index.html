            <h2>Stage One: The Self-Focused Reaction</h2>
            
            <p>This is the most primal stage, a state of pure emotion. Our focus is entirely on ourselves. We are trapped in feelings of anger and misunderstanding, asking: <em>"Why is this happening to me? How could they treat me this way?"</em> We cannot see beyond our own pain.</p>
            
            <h2>Stage Two: The Path of Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>Here, we begin to turn inward. We start to examine our own role in the conflict and consider the other person's perspective. We ask ourselves: <em>"Could I have handled this better? Is it possible their reaction had valid reasons?"</em></p>
            
            <h2>Stage Three: Emotional Maturity</h2>
            
            <p>At this stage, a true emotional maturity emerges. We are able to understand and accept the other person's limitations, recognizing their own struggles and the circumstances that may have been beyond their control.</p>
            
            <p>There is a generosity of spirit here—an ability to hold space for the actions of others with an open heart, and to resolve conflict calmly. It is the wisdom of an elder who can understand the struggles of the young because they have walked that path themselves.</p>
            
            <p>This is the wisdom of knowing when to take a step back to see a broader view. By accepting others, we also learn to accept ourselves.</p>
            
            <p>We reflect on our mistakes, but we also acknowledge our own limitation. We can admit when we are wrong, forgive ourselves, and actively continue to grow.</p>
            
            <p>To reach this stage is a sign of a truly mature mind, and it has nothing to do with age.</p>

            <h2>Stage Four: Awareness</h2>
            
            <p><em>(This is where modern psychology often stops)</em></p>
            
            <p>Here, we develop an awareness of the patterns behind our actions. We recognize that all behavior has underlying triggers, and that hurtful actions often stem from past wounds.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a person who constantly seeks validation may have a deep history of not being recognized. Those who were deprived of love in their childhood may cling to unhealthy relationships.</p>

            <h2>Stage Five: Seeing Interconnected Causes</h2>
            
            <p>In this stage, we understand that the cause of things is never as simple as it appears on the surface.</p>
            
            <p>We begin to see the vast, interwoven causality of the universe, where all conditions merge and flow together.</p>
            
            <p>The grand pageant of the world begin to feel like a temporary play. We realize there is no need to be so entangled in them, no need to obsess over every gain and loss. We come to trust that every experience is here to help us grow.</p>
            
            <h2>Stage Six: Unshakable Peace</h2>
            
            <p>This is the stage of tranquil acceptance. Nothing can disturb the peace within.</p>
            
            <p>We look upon all people and all things without judgment—without the labels of "good" or "bad," "right" or "wrong."</p>
            
            <p>Like watching a river flow, we observe everything as it happens. We can navigate the storms of the world, witness the joys and sorrows of humanity, and yet, within our own heart, abide in deep peace and a quiet clarity.</p>
